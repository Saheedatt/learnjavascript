//1. Use the map method to create a new array where each element is twice the corresponding element in the original array.
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
// Your code here

//2. Use the filter method to create a new array containing only the even numbers from the original array.
const numbers1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
// Your code here

//3. Use the reduce method to calculate the sum of all numbers in the array.
const numbers2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
// Your code here

//4. Use the forEach method to log the square of each number in the array.
const numbers3 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
// Your code here

//5. Use the find method to find the first even number in the array.
const numbers4 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

//6. Use the slice method to create a new array that includes elements from index 2 to index 4.
let array4 = ["Johnson", "Concord", "blessing", "Monday", 'Becoming', "Jolade"];

//7. Use the splice method to remove two elements starting from index 2 and replace them with "strawberry" and "avocado".
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "fig"];
// Your code here

//8. Use the sort method to order the array alphabetically.
//  Use the sort method to sort the array of numbers in descending order.   
const numbers5 = [5, 2, 8, 1, 4];
// Your code here

//9. Use the reverse method to create a new array that contains the elements of the original array in reverse order.

//10. Use the join method to create a string from the elements of the array, separated by commas.

//11. Use the every method to check if all elements in the array are less than 10.

//12. Use the some method to check if at least one element in the array is greater than 10.

//13. Use the includes method to check if the array contains the element "apple".

//14. Use the indexOf method to find the index of the element "cherry".

//15. Use the lastIndexOf method to find the index of the last occurrence of the element "cherry".
