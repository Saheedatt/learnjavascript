# Learn Javascript
 Circle-75 is a learning circle at AltSchool Africa. We decided to come together as a group to learn JavaScript together and practice exercises in an attempt to all gain a better understanding of JavaScript.

## Pages
- `index.js` : Contains the basics of JavaScript. It has variable declaration, data types, type  conversion, basic operations and operators in JavaScript.

- `conditionals.js` : Here, we looked at the different ways of writing conditional statements using:
    - if-else statements
    - switch statements
    - ternary operators

- `functions.js` : In this file, we looked at the diffrent ways to write functions: 
    - Function declaration, 
    - Function expression, 
    - Arrow function, 
    - Modern arrow function. 
    We also learnt about callbacks, returning values and also learnt about naming functions appropriately. 

- `exercises.js`: Contains pracitce questions for the things that we learn as we move forward.
